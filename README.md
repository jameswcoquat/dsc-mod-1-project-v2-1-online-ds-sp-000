### Future Improvement

This project represents my initial foray into python libraries and follows basic requirements outlined in Flatiron objectives for an initial exploratory data analysis exercise. 

A more robust analysis would certainly be in order. As my skills improve, I may revisit and execute the following:

* Expanded data set leveraging web scraping, APIs, other sources
* Improved Python code and visualizations leveraging more advanced functions, libraries, classes, etc.
